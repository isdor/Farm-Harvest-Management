# FarmHarvestManagement

This repository contains a Python notebook designed to help farmers calculate total harvest, expenses, and profits. It demonstrates basic arithmetic operations, variable assignment, and print functions using a farm harvest management scenario.

## Overview

This Jupyter notebook (`farm_harvest_management.ipynb`) provides a step-by-step guide to calculating key financial metrics for a farm harvest season. It covers:

- **Total Harvest Calculation:** Summing up wheat and potato harvest in kilograms.
- **Expense Calculation:** Determining total expenses in dollars from seed and labour costs.
- **Revenue Calculation:** Computing total revenue in dollars based on produce prices and harvest quantities.
- **Profit Calculation:** Finding the total profit by subtracting expenses from revenue.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand how to perform basic arithmetic operations in Python.
- Learn how to assign numerical values to variables.
- Practice using the `print()` function to display results.

## Usage
